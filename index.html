       <h3>A small idea and a bit of motivation</h3>
       <p>We decided to make games, Rhiannon doesn't have a technical background, but Mark has a degree in computer science. So, a Master's in horticulture and some inspiration led us to where we are now; making games becuase we just enjoy doing it. Our first game is a little idle farming game called "HortiCAT" and was built as just a simple excursion into learning the basics of Godot and programming in general.</p>

      <h3>A full mobile game, known as HortiCAT!</h3>
      <p>For months now, we've been working hard almost every day after work to make a full scale idle farming mobile game. It's been a ton of work, but it's been very rewarding. Not to mention, we are already planning our next few games! We've both learned a lot from this experience, in terms of project management, code structuring, and game design!</p>

       <h3>A game about growing plants</h3>
       <p>Rhiannon used her knowledge of plants to make a very accurate, beautiful rendition of real world plants, their different stages of growth, and how they look when harvested! She did almost all of the art in the game, WHILE learning coding, Mark did the duties of a pseudo tech lead, helping manage and make 'stories' and designed features that they'd both work on together.</p>

        <h3>A fully featured Mobile farming title!</h3>
        <p>You can plant, harvest, grow, fertilize, water, even craft the products into more expensive ones! The scaling is exponential, but unlike most idle games, this one does have a finite ending! We made it because we just love the vibes and the art, and we hope you do too!</p>

       <p>We have other projects coming down the pipeline, but we are hard at work trying to get our stuff on the play store.</p>
