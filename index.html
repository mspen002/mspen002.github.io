       <h3>True Adaptability</h3>
       <p>Always willing to learn, but never willing to quit. I'm enthusastic and positive, I love solving problems, and I enjoy helping people. I'm a little nerdy, I love video games, and I have quite a collection of medieval weaponry.</p>

       <h3>Adrift, a fully VR experience</h3>
       <p>With only a few weeks, and no team, I wanted to come up with an idea that would capitalize on the idea of a VR space, while being unique. As a student, I was light on assets, and even lighter on funding. This, project I'm extremely proud of, was the result.</p>

        <h3>A rhythm based bullet hell in first person</h3>
        <p>The third place winner of the 2017 Santa Barbara Hackathon; put against proof of concept type applications. Our project was fully functional, where the majority of the competition, including the first and second place winners were simple tech demos. I constructed all the enemy AI patterns, as well as designed much of the look and feel of the game.</p>

       <h3>A 7 week team project, with a silly name</h3>
       <p>Skeleton Man was some of my first experience in making games, at least, taking the lead on making games. I created all scripts for the main character, all the art assets, never having done art before and aided with AI and other tasks I needed to help with.</p>

        <h3>A mobile game, fast paced, pick up and play</h3>
        <p>The objective is to tag every enemy on screen with a limited amount of time, with only one continuous line. As the game progresses, more enemies are likely to spawn, and the faster you'll have to be, while maintaining precision. I constructed the AI, and random generation to not continuously destroy enemy objects, as Unity has performance issues if you fill up it's "trash can", so the game uses page pooled enemy spawning.</p>

       <h3>Recreating a miniature version of OpenGL</h3>
       <p>An extremely difficult project, but also one of my favorites. I built a Z-buffer approach to rendering, utilizing most everything I knew at the time to create a barebones version of an extremely iconic graphics library.</p>

       <h3>Changing an operating system to use a downward growing stack</h3>
       <p>Operating systems was tough for me to grasp, but this project ended up being one of my proudest. Changing the way memory is used in the XV6 operating system to change from a regular stack to a downward growing stack.</p>

       <h3>And that's just about it</h3>
       <p>I've done other projects, but I believe that these ones are some of my best, and the most worth people's time to look at. Plus, games are a lot easier to present than an android app, or a feature selection algorithm. But, thanks for looking at my website. I hope you have a great day.</p>
